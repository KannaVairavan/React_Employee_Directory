# Employee Directory

## User Story

- As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Summary

This application is a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This site is deployed to Heroku. This app follows
the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language,
Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Installation:

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.

The user should be able to:

- Sort the table by at least one category

- Filter the users by at least one property.
```
